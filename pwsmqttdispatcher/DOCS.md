# PWS to MQTT dispatcher addon

## How to use

Once installed and started, the addon listens on port `8765` which the PWS can connect to.  The PWS must be configured to the `haas` host instead of the built-in Wunderground update URL (usually `rtupdate.wunderground.com`).

The addon will also relay the incoming updates to Wunderground.com.
