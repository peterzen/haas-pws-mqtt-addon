# PWS to MQTT dispatcher addon for Home Assistant

This Home Assistant add-on retrieves live weather data from a WH2600 personal weather station (PWS) and publishes it to an MQTT topic where HAAS can access it as sensor information.

Supported weather stations: tested on Renkforce WH2600, probably also supports Froggit units but I can't verify it.

## Installation
