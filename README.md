# PWS to MQTT dispatcher addon for Home Assistant



This addon was inspired by the [Wunderground Update Receiver Binding](https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/wundergroundupdatereceiver/)
 for OpenHAB.

The addon acts as a receiver for Personal Weather Stations (WH9000) and publishes the received updates to an MQTT topic, as well as on to [Wunderground.com](https://Wunderground.com).
